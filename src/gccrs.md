# `gccrs`

[`gccrs`](https://github.com/rust-gcc/gccrs) is an alternative compiler for the Rust
programming language, developed from the ground up for the
[GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)](https://gcc.gnu.org) project.

While `gccrs` is not yet able to compile Rust code, it is progressing fast — we are hoping we will be able to compile the Rust 1.49 standard library by the next GCC release, 14.1.

Once that milestone is achieved, we will begin catching up to the Rust version used by Rust-for-Linux — in the hopes of being useful quickly!

You can follow the project's progress on [our blog](https://rust-gcc.github.io)
